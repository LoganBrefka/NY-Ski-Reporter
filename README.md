This is a Python script that uses the selenium API to gather valuable data for skiers from well known mountains in Upstate New York.

-If you would like to run this on your machine, do the following:

1. Install a python environment on your machine
   -Note, I used pycharm, but any python IDE will work. However, Pycharm seems to be the most user friendly.

2. Installing pip or pip3 to your machine(Windows/Mac)
   -Note, pip may already be on your machine. To check, go to your local terminal and type, pip --version. If it responds saying "command not found," try pip3 --version. If you are still prompted
   with the message, "command not found," you have to install pip on your machine.

   - To install refer to this article for MacOs and Windows, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-in-macos/
   
  
3. Install Selenium(Windows/Mac)
   - to install selenium open your local terminal and type the following, pip3 install selenium. If that does not work, try pip install selenium.

4. Install chrome Webdriver
   - First, open chrome and navigate to the 3 dots on the upper right hand corner. Then, click the Help section(second from the bottom), and check for your version of Chrome. 
   - Next, visit https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads/version-selection and if your chrome is up to date, click the Chrome For testing dashboard and download the appropriate chrome version for your machine. If your version is older
     then Chrome Version 115, follow Webdrivers step by step to install Chrome Webdriver Version 114 and older.
     
   -finally, unzip the download file containing Chrome Webdriver. You will need to take the file named "chrome driver" and move it to a specific file location. 
   For Mac, Hit command + shift + g to open up the file directory. Then type usr/local/bin and place the file into it.
   For Windows, move the file to your C drive directory, for more detailed installation for Windows refer to the video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz59GsdvUF8
